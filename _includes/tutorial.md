# Tutorial
Following on from the quick start lets have a little deeper look at how Minke actually works.

## Run minke
```bash
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) nicholasjackson/minke /bin/bash -c 'minke'
```

You should see the below output showing the help options and the currently installed generators.

Usage: minke [options]
    -e, --encrypt STRING             Encrypt a string
    -k, --key STRING                 Private key to use for encryption
    -g, --generator GENERATOR        Generator plugin to use
    -o, --output OUTPUT              Output folder
    -a, --application_name NAME      Application name
    -n, --namespace NAMESPACE        Application namespace
```

## Scaffold a project
We can now scaffold a new go Î¼Service using the following command:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) nicholasjackson/minke /bin/bash -c 'minke -g minke-generator-go -o $(pwd) -n github.com/nicholasjackson -a helloworld'
```

If look at the output folder we will see something like the below folder structure, all our source code is in the root and there is a **_build** folder, this is where Minke stores things like the Docker and Docker Compose files and configuration.

## Building and testing your application
Change to the **_build** folder

```
$ cd _build
```
To avoid the pain of having to craft a ridiculously long docker run cmd every time you want to run a command there is a bash script `minke.sh` in the build folder.  This simply runs the commands specified as arguments inside the Minke Docker container.  The parent folder to _build (source root) is mapped as a volume inside the container with the same path as your local folder and the working directory is set to _build folder.

Since Minke is primarily uses Rake you can run `$ ./minke.sh rake -T` to see the various options available to you.

```
rake app:build              # build application
rake app:build_and_run      # build and run application with Docker Compose
rake app:build_image        # build Docker image for application
rake app:cucumber[feature]  # run end to end Cucumber tests USAGE: rake app:cucumber[@tag]
rake app:fetch              # fetch dependent packages
rake app:push               # push built image to Docker registry
rake app:run                # run application with Docker Compose
rake app:test               # run unit tests
rake docker:fetch_images    # pull images for golang from Docker registry if not already downloaded
rake docker:update_images   # updates build images for swagger and golang will overwrite existing images
```

### Building the application
To build the application simply execute:

```bash
$ ./minke.sh rake app:build
```
The steps minke performs are:
1. Download Docker image or build image specified by the generator.
2. Start a new build container.
3. Fetch any dependencies.
4. Execute build command specified by the generator.

The output will look something like below.
```bash
# Loading installed generators
registered minke-generator-netmvc
run fetch

The build task has a dependency on the fetch task so before we try to build anything we will fetch the dependencies (in this instance from nuget) before executing the build.
All of the code is run inside the docker container however most generators will use the physical disk of the Docker server to cache the output.  This just speeds up the whole process and allows you to utilise any caching behaviour of your CI environment if needed.

### Running the unit tests
```bash
$ rake app:test
```
Running the unit tests is a similar process, before we run the tests we will build the application code and fetch any dependencies.  It all runs inside a container.

### Build yourself an image
So we are going to run the cucumber tests against a Docker container and ultimately you want to run this on your server anyway so lets build an image which can be launched.
```bash
$ rake app:build_image
```

Thats all you need this will build and test your application code then copy the assets into the right location to be packaged up into a Docker image, all of the steps is configurable checkout the section on Config for more information.

### Functional tests
Having unit tests for your code covers you a little however there is a real benefit to having a good behavioural test suite which may even test the integration of your application with other dependencies such as database servers.
Minke uses Cucumber and Docker to facilitate this, it spins up a stack using Docker Compose and executes the Cucumber tests against it.  
Running the functional tests is as easy as...

```bash
$ rake app:cucumber
```

This will start the stack with Docker Compose using a standard format compose file which can be found in the **_build** folder, it loads any config that we may require for the service into Consul and then waits for the service to start before executing the Cucumber tests.  
And you have to do nothing other than write the test and setup the config all logic for service discovery and waiting for the service to start is handled for you.
All being well you should see some output like the stuff listed below.

```bash

It really is that easy now all you need to do is push the image to the server and open a beer.  If you have managed to get this far I recommend checking out the documentation on the configuration files to see how you can customise and extend your build.
